        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          Deciding whether to talk to an employer about caring can be daunting. But if you do, it could benefit you both. Most employers are eager to support employees at work and may 
          be able to provide support that you’re not aware of. You can find 
          <a class="govuk-link" href="https://carers.org/support-for-working-carers/talking-about-your-caring-role-at-work">tips for talking about your caring role at work on Carers Trust</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          Most types of work allow for some level of flexibility. Consider speaking to employers about what flexible options they could offer. Some types of work can allow for more flexibility 
          than others. So, if you’ve explored all support options in your current role but need more help, you could look at different roles to see if they’re more flexible. You can get free 
          and impartial advice about support you may expect from your employer from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.acas.org.uk/contact">ACAS</a> or

        </p>
        <h1 class="job-help-h1">Support options</h1>
        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          Here are some options you may want to discuss with employers.
        </p>
        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Flexible working</span> is a way of working that suits your needs and the business needs of an employer. For example, having flexible start and 
          finish times, or working part-time. If you’re an employee and have worked for the same employer for a continuous period of 26 weeks, you can make a statutory request for flexible 
          working. Find out more about the

        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Taking time off in emergencies</span> – if you’re an employee (no matter how long you’ve been in employment), you’re allowed to take a 
          reasonable amount of time off work for an emergency involving someone who depends on you for care. For example, if they have a fall and are hurt, or if other care support is 
          cancelled suddenly and you need to step in. You should discuss with your employer whether any time you take off for an emergency will be paid.

        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Support networks and policies</span> – your employer may offer extra support to help you at work. For example, some employers have support 
          groups for employees who look after someone or may agree for you to take a career break. Ask your employer what they offer and also check your employment contract and handbook.
