          You’re not alone in supporting someone with their care. Getting support early on can help you to manage work and caring. For example, if you’re just starting to look after 
          someone, having support in place early can help you to adapt your arrangements in the future if things change.
        </p>
        <h1 class="job-help-h1">Support from your local authority</h1>
        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          If you care for someone or need care, you may be entitled to get support from your local authority. Often, the first step to getting this support is understanding what’s needed.
        </p>
        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          To see what could make your life easier if you look after someone else, you may be able to get a free 
          <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/support-and-benefits-for-carers/carer-assessments/">carer’s assessment</a>. Recommendations can include someone to take over caring so you can take a break or connections to local support.
        </p>
        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          To see what support or equipment could be provided to help the person who needs care live more independently and safely, they may be able to get a free

        </p>
        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          There’s also other support available. For example, if you’re finding it hard to shop or prepare meals for the person you look after, some local authorities can provide meals 
          services (also known as meals on wheels). Find out more:

        <h1 class="job-help-h1">Planning ahead</h1>
        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          Support yourself by planning ahead and putting in place backup plans. This helps to make sure that care is sustainable and manageable if things change. For example, write down 
          what care the person needs and what others should do if you can’t continue providing support for any reason. Find out more about

        </p>
        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          You may want to consider applying for a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) or Powers of Attorney in Scotland. Once in place, this legally allows you to make health and 
          financial decisions for the person you care for if they’re unable to make decisions themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          The person you care for must have the mental capacity to consent to getting an LPA, so consider planning ahead so you can make decisions about their care if they’re unable to. 
          Even if you’re next of kin for the person you care for, you may not automatically have rights to make decisions on their behalf without an LPA. Find out more:

        <h1 class="job-help-h1">Share caring with others</h1>
        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          If you can, try not to take on everything yourself. By sharing care, you’ll ensure the person you care for can be supported if you’re unavailable. You’ll also find it easier 
          to make time to look after yourself, and to combine caring and work if you want to.
        </p>
        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          Talk to family and friends to see if caring can be shared. To support these conversations and understand your current situation, try to map out the people and services you 
          interact with for support. This can help you spot any gaps in support and to discuss with others how caring could be shared.
        </p>
        <h1 class="job-help-h1">Breaks from caring</h1>
        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          As or when you need to, you can take a break from caring while the person you care for is looked after by someone else. This is also known as carers’ breaks or respite breaks. 
          A break could range from a few hours to a short stay in a care home.

        <p class="job-help-text-black">
          Some people can find it difficult to speak to the person they care for about getting more support. For advice on having these conversations, you may find it helpful to find your
