      Sharing care with family and friends
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Caring for a loved one with health needs often requires teamwork and this may mean relying on each other for support and sharing care activities. It is important you decide on who 
      will be responsible for which tasks.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      There are aspects you should consider when sharing care with family and friends: 
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>You may find that it is best to first allocate a primary caregiver. That way the primary caregiver can step in if there is a crisis</li>
      <li>
        You may find that it’s best to discuss each other’s strengths and skills and then agree in advance how your efforts can complement one another so you play to each other’s 
        strengths and become an effective team
      </li>
      <li>You may need to use the PREPARE acronym from our page on Planning Ahead, to help you consider how much you can actually do.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-padding-top-4">
      Supporting your loved one’s independent living
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If supporting your loved one’s independent living is the best option for you, there are some things that may help, including home adaptations, mobility equipment, 
      household gadgets and monitoring systems. Find out more information on the NHS webpages linked below:

      Sharing your home with your loved one requiring care
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If your loved one requiring care doesn’t live with you, the time may come when you start thinking about sharing your home with them. This might be because they’ll need more care in the 
      future if their health gets worse, or they’ve recently come out of hospital after an illness or fall. Visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/practical-tips-if-you-care-for-someone/sharing-your-home-advice-for-carers/">NHS website</a>
